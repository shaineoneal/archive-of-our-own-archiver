# AO3 Archiver

A re-write of (AO3 Enhancements)[https://github.com/jsmnbom/ao3-enhancements] that saves your works to a google sheets file stored on your google account.

I began this project with no knowledge of Typescript, React, or Webpack and boy have I learned a lot since beginninning this project.

A LOT of work still needs to be done, but at the moment, the app is (mostly) functional and I have been able to successfully use it on my phone with minimal issues.
